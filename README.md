## NLP VADER Sentiment Analysis on Earnings Call Transcripts

### Overview
NLP analysis on Sentiment from Earnings Calls. Do different parts of the call (scripted management discussion vs Q&A section) show different sentiment based on evaluation of transcripts from the calls. VADER is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion. It is available in the NLTK package and can be applied directly to unlabeled text data.
